Received tuple from the main stream: @1535700855383 s1 (ds1,180,180)
The data subject ds1 does not have a past condition over the stream 3 but there exists a condition fom him along the chain.
There exists a static condition from the data subject ds1 over the stream 3
There is a value about ds1 from the stream 3. Setting this as the last value associated to the waiting tuple.
Checking conditions for tuple @1535700854421 s1 (ds1,166,166)
This is the first PCC on the chian, so it is going to trigger the releasing of the tuple.

Updating the most recent value which has been globally seen for stream 3 and data subject ds1
There is already a previous value.
The previous value is older than the one just received. Updating.
Updated value: @1535700855079 s3 (ds1,198)
Received tuple from the main stream: @1535700855679 s1 (ds1,90,90)
The data subject ds1 does not have a past condition over the stream 3 but there exists a condition fom him along the chain.
There exists a static condition from the data subject ds1 over the stream 3
There is a value about ds1 from the stream 3. Setting this as the last value associated to the waiting tuple.
Checking conditions for tuple @1535700854689 s1 (ds1,193,193)
This is the first PCC on the chian, so it is going to trigger the releasing of the tuple.
Adding to the tuple the result for the static condition specified by data subject ds1
The tuple is currently waiting (event time case)
Found tuple from the stream 3 associated to the tuple being processed from the main stream. Using that to check stati condition.
Received new tuple on stream 3: @1535700855339 s3 (ds1,138)
There exists a static condition for the associated data subject ds1
